# Food-Diary-cum-Tracker

Another project built using Flask and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

The project is built for one to keep a track of the food that the person has consumed. The person, if unregistered, can get the amount of calories s/he need to take on regular basis as well as measure the total calories in the food that they consume. The data being the obtained from FatSecret. However, on registering the person can maintain a diary of what the person is eating in order to keep a track of the daily consumption of all the nutrients besides calories.

Note: The Front-End may not be great but I have tried to make the best use of the available templates. Two dummy pages are present: About and Contact.
